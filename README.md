AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

This project is a part of the AirBnB Clone project, which is aimed at building a full web application. This project is focused on building a command-line interface to manage AirBnB objects. The command interpreter can be used to perform various operations on the objects such as creating a new object, retrieving an object, updating attributes of an object, destroying an object, and performing operations on objects.

This project is divided into several tasks, and each task is linked to the other and will help in building a parent class, serializing and deserializing instances, creating classes for AirBnB objects, creating the first storage engine for the project, and creating unit tests to validate the classes and storage engine.

To use the command interpreter, follow the below steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run the command interpreter by typing "./console.py" in the terminal.
Use the following commands to manage the objects:
create: creates a new object
show: displays the details of an object
all: displays all the objects
update: updates the attributes of an object
destroy: deletes an object
quit: exits the command interpreter
For more details about the command interpreter, refer to the documentation provided in the project.\
